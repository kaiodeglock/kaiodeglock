## 💜 About Me

I'm an **Information Technology enthusiast** and a student of **Systems Analysis and Development** (*Análise e Desenvolvimento de Sistemas*).

Even though I'm still at the beginning of my journey in programming, I’m highly motivated to learn, improve every day, and build a solid career in tech.

I’m especially excited about how technology can be used to **solve problems**, **improve routines**, and **help people in real work environments**.

---

## 🎯 Career Goal

My main goal is to **enter the job market in the IT field** and use my knowledge to **contribute as much as possible to my workplace**, always growing professionally and learning new skills.

## 📚 Current Learning Stage

Right now, I’m focused on building a strong foundation before diving into programming languages.

### What I’m focusing on:
- Programming logic
- IT fundamentals
- Git and GitHub basics
- Problem-solving mindset
- Study discipline and continuous improvement

---

## 🚀 My Journey (Starting from Zero, Building with Purpose)

I’m currently in the early phase of my tech journey, which means:

- ✅ I’m developing the right mindset for learning technology
